It has practical uses such as providing warmth, serving as a makeshift bed or raft, and even aiding in combat. It can also be used as a distress signal or for drying off. Beyond its physical uses, a towel also holds significant psychological value. If a non-hitchhiker, or \"strag\", sees a hitchhiker with a towel, they will assume the hitchhiker also possesses other essential items and may lend them any items they might need. Furthermore, a hitchhiker who manages to keep track of their towel despite the challenges of interstellar travel is considered highly competent, leading to the slang phrase, \"There's a frood who really knows where his towel is.\""}]}

These included some letters from the council about the proposed demolition of his house and the setting up of a public inquiry into a bypass scheme in the area. There was also an old letter from Greenpeace, an ecological pressure group he occasionally contributed to, asking for help with their scheme to release dolphins and orcas from captivity. Additionally, there were some postcards from friends who were vaguely complaining that he never got in touch."}]}
